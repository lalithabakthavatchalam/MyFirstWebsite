				<div class="answer">
				<p>Today was a particularly challenging day...Dr. Tarek was fantastic, he knew exactly what to say, told me some wonderful analogies about recovery, made me see all the positives about how I am doing in recovery, and gave me a HUGE tissue (the one's he puts on the bed)....<br />
				I went into Tarek feeling fairly glum, but came out laughing at all his jokes!

				<div class="answer">
				<p>I've been to 3 other GPs over the eD with very disappointing results. <b>I wish that every doctor was like Dr. Tarek,</b> he is the only doctor ever not to just say that the ED will just go away or try and prescribe me some pills and send me off!!
				</p>
				<h4>Posted By: Princess C from Dublin</h4>

				<div class="answer">
				<p>I'm still laughing here thinking about Tarek and his giant hanky!!! like <b>Princess C</b> said I wish every doctor could be like Tarek. Similarly I had some AWFUL experiences with GPs and other doctors/consultants - it seems the minute they heard the word eating disorder they automatically despised me.<br/><br/>So when it was suggested to me that I go see Tarek, I put it off because I didn't want to hear how "Stupid" I was or be told to "cop on" once again. Eventually I took the trip to Malahide Roadm heart thumping in my chest and shaking with nerves, waiting for the disapproving look when I walked into the surgery and the long lextures which I had heard a million times before. Ofcourse, the reality was totally different. Dr. Tarek made me feel at ease almost immediately with his jokes and his Fr. Ted quotes.<br/><br/>He has such an <b>amazing understanding</b> of Eating Distress and I have never felt judged or looked down upon, which was a first for me when it came to doctors. He actually listened to me instead of just seeing a walking Eating Distress and didnt try to shut me up with meds.<br/><br/>
				Yes, he gave me a bit of hard time when he had, but it was only to spell out the seriousness of the situation to me. The rest of the time he was <b>Compassionate, PATIENT, understanding and did SO much to help me</b> and I will always be very grateful to him</p>

				<p>Who is this Wonderful Dr. Tarek..!!
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Who is he...as above he is the GP linked with Marino...they just forgot to add that he is the <b>BEST G.P</b> around, particularly if your having a 'bad day'...he has the best cures for <b>putting a smile back on our faces!!!</b></p>

				<div class="answer">
				<p>I am smiling here, thinking back of my experience with Dr. Tarek over the years... would have been quite similar at times...<br/>And so would have been his reaction...if it wasn't a huge tissue it was something else to <b>bring the smile back on my face.</b>&nbsp;At one of my first visits he gave me a sticker with a smiling strawberry face that said: "I've been good at the Doctors today"
				I still have it stuck to the glovebox in my car!!!</p>
